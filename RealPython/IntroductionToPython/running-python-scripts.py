# Overview and the Python Interpreter
# The python interpreter takes the code that you write and converts it into the language that the computer's hardware understands (machine code).
# It does this each time you run a python script (this is the reason why you need python installed on the machine from which you are running your script).
# Various implementations of python include:
#    CPython - the core implementation of the language
#    Jython - written in Java
#    PyPy - written in Python
#    IronPython - targets .NET
#    MicroPython - runs on microcontrollers
# How does Python run a script?
#    Process the statements of the script
#    Compile the source code to bytecode
#    Ship code off for execution
#    Python Virtual Machine - runs the code that you've written at the lowest level

# Modules vs. Scripts
# Scripts are top-level files, intended for execution by the user
# Modules are intended to be imported

# Running Code Interactively
# Open a shell such as Anaconda Powershell (you can also type -> cmd <- at the windows logo)
# Type -> python <- at the prompt
# To exit the interpreter type -> exit() <-
# To exit the shell type -> exit <-

# Running Code from the Command Line
# Go to the directory where your script is saved (example script --> hello.py)
# At the prompt type -> python hello.py <-

# Running Code from a File Manager



# Running Code from an IDE or Text Editor
