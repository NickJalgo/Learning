    " * No upfront costs - instead of paying for data centers and servers you pay on-demand for consuming computing resources\n",
    "* Benefit from massive economies of scale\n",
    " * Usage from many customers aggregated in the cloud reduces the marginal costs for all customers\n",
    "* Stop guessing capacity\n",
    " * Eliminate guesswork about infrastructure capacity needs. Instead of paying for idle or underutilized servers, you can scale up or down to meet the current need.\n",
    "* Increase speed and agility\n",
    " * Launch resources within a few clicks in minutes instead of waiting days or weeks for on-premises deployment\n",
    "* Stope spending money on running and maintain data centers\n",
    " * Focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers\n",
    "* Go global in minutes\n",
    " * Deploy your app in multiple regions around the world with a few clicks\n",
    " * Provide lower latency and a better experience for you customers at minimal costs"
